# Welcome to IdaNB-Hub

This is the central GitHub organization for **IdaNB**, a framework for building and sharing interactive Jupyter notebooks.

## 🚀 About the Project

**IdaNB** provides a foundational environment for creating interactive analysis workflows using Jupyter notebooks. It is **primarily designed for digital forensics and security analysis**, offering a standardized toolkit for reproducible investigations.

While forensics is the primary focus, the framework is general-purpose and can be adapted for a wide range of data analysis, research, or educational needs.

## 🏛️ Purpose of this Organization

This organization's repositories host all the necessary source code, connectors, and documentation to build, deploy, manage, and contribute to the IdaNB ecosystem.

This GitHub organization serves as the central hub for the project.

## 🧭 Repository Structure

The project is organized into several key repositories:

* **IdaNB**: The core framework. This repository contains the main application, foundational code, and core components of the IdaNB platform.
* **Connectors**: A collection of modules and plugins for integrating with various data sources, forensic tools, and external services.
* **Deployment**: Configuration files and automation scripts (e.g., Ansible) for deploying a production-ready JupyterHub server configured for IdaNB.
* *(Additional repositories for documentation, examples, and specialized tools will be added as the project evolves.)*
